\title{Brier score}
\usage{
Brier(probabilities, truth, negative, positive)
}
\arguments{
\item{probabilities}{[numeric] vector of predicted probabilities}

\item{truth}{vector of true values}

\item{negative}{negative class}

\item{positive}{positive class}
}
\description{
The Brier score is defined as the quadratic difference between the probability and the value (1,0) for the class.
That means we use the numeric representation 1 and 0 for our target classes. It is similiar to the mean squared error in regression.
multiclass.brier is the sum over all one vs. all comparisons and for a binary classifcation 2 * brier.
